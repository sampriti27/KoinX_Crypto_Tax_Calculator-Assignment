## Features

### Mandatory Features

1. **User Interface**: Implemented the UI as per the provided Figma design, excluding the navbar and footer section.

2. **Dropdowns**: Restricted the financial year and country dropdowns to the values specified in the design.

3. **Calculator Logic**:
   - Users can enter purchase price, sale price, expenses, investment type, and annual income.
   - The application calculates gains, tax rate, and taxes based on the following rules:
     - Tax rate varies based on the annual income according to the provided image.
     - Capital gains amount is calculated as (Sale Price - Purchase Price - Expenses).
     - Long-term gains discount is applied if the investment type is "Long Term."
     - Net capital gains are calculated as (Capital Gains Amount - Discount for Long Term Gains) for "Long Term" investments.
     - Tax to be paid is calculated based on the provided image.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Provided an example calculation with detailed results for users to understand the process.
     
     - Purchase Price = 50
     - Sale Price = 100
     - Expenses = 20
     - Investment Type = Long Term
     - Annual Income = ($45001 - $120000).

    - For the above inputs, calculation would be:
        - Tax Rate = “$5092 + 32.5% of excess over $45000”
        - Capital Gains Amount = 30
        - Long Term Capital Gains Discount = 15
        - Net Capital Gains Amount = 15
        - Tax you need to pay = 4.875 (which is 32.5% of 15)

5. **GitHub Repository**: Hosted the project on GitHub.

6. **Deployment**: Deployed the project using Vercel.

### Optional Features
